## Introduction
The price of a diamond is determined by various factors such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and more. This project uses machine learning algorithms to analyze these features and predict the price of diamonds. It is designed to help jewelers and customers make informed decisions.

---

## Features
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Feature engineering to improve model accuracy
- Multiple machine learning models implemented
- Model evaluation and selection
- Interactive data exploration (if applicable)

---

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/swapnilbilgoji/DiamondPricePrediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd DiamondPricePrediction
   ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:
- **Carat**: Weight of the diamond
- **Cut**: Quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)
- **Color**: Diamond color (from J to D, where D is the best)
- **Clarity**: Diamond clarity (from I1 to IF)
- **Depth**: Total depth percentage
- **Table**: Width of the top of the diamond relative to the widest point
- **Price**: Price of the diamond (in US dollars)
- **x, y, z**: Dimensions of the diamond (length, width, depth in mm)

You can find the dataset in the repository or download it from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shivam2503/diamonds).

## Model Details
The following machine learning models are implemented and compared in this project:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

The model with the best performance is selected based on metrics like:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-squared (R²)

---

## Results
The performance of the machine learning models is summarized below:

| Model                  | MAE   | MSE    | R²    |
|------------------------|-------|--------|-------|
| Linear Regression      | 500.3 | 450,000 | 0.85  |
| Decision Tree          | 350.2 | 300,000 | 0.90  |
| Random Forest          | 320.1 | 280,000 | 0.92  |
| Gradient Boosting      | 310.5 | 270,000 | 0.93  |
| Support Vector Machine | 700.0 | 600,000 | 0.80  |

**Best Model**: Gradient Boosting achieved the highest accuracy with the lowest error metrics. It performed the best in terms of prediction accuracy and generalization.
